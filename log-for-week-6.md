# what I was trying to do

This week, I learned on how to view topic models, and how to visually interpret data  which otherwise would have been impossible to see.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

Topic models can be useful in many fields, because analysing data from different perspectives is something that can allow us to gain a different view on a certain subjects.

## what I did

+   Analysed topic model
	+ I started by going through many of the word groups to look at how the dates changed over time, and I also noticed many significant changes on the yearly view of the topic model.
+ Compared with "A Topic Model of World Archarology"
	+ I noticed many similarities between both topic models, both in how the popularity of certain topics changes over time, and how certain biases in the data collection affect the end result.

## challenges 

It was difficult in some cases to verify the accuracy of some of the data that was available. Some articles only had one or two words in common with each other, and they varied greatly across a vast amount of topics.

## thoughts on where to go next

It would be interesting to try this again but wth more specific words and topics, to see what comes up. Certainly there are biases in the topic model method which could be corrected in the future, and results could possibly be refined through the use of AI.
